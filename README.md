This project is part of my Web Development Internship (Task 2). It features an **interactive, fixed navigation menu** that enhances user experience with dynamic styling.

The navigation bar changes style when scrolling and provides hover effects for menu items, creating a modern, responsive interface.<br>

- **Scroll Interaction:** Navbar background and text color change when scrolling.
- **Hover Effects:** Menu links highlight with a gold background and black text on hover.
- **Active Link Indicator:** Highlights the current page section.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.<br>


## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the navbar and page sections.
- **CSS:** Styling, hover effects, scroll animations, and transitions.
- **JavaScript:** Detects page scroll and toggles navbar style dynamically.<br>
